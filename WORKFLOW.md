# Spreadsheet Table Diagnosis Workflow

This file is a compact note on how the repository is meant to handle spreadsheet problems.

The basic idea is simple: look at the table first, then choose a practical way to clean, match, summarize, or troubleshoot it in Excel and WPS.

That sounds obvious, but a surprising amount of spreadsheet pain starts right after people skip that step.

## Core Workflow

1. Inspect the input

- Check whether the input contains headers, sample rows, CSV content, or just a direct task description.
- If the table structure is still unclear, ask for the smallest amount of extra context needed.

2. Diagnose the table

- Identify likely column types such as IDs, names, dates, status fields, amounts, phone numbers, or free text.
- Look for blanks, duplicates, mixed formats, unstable keys, and columns that should be cleaned before formulas are applied.

3. Choose the most practical path

- Prefer simple formulas when they are stable and easy to maintain.
- Prefer Excel and WPS compatible approaches over newer functions with weaker compatibility.
- Prefer helper columns when a single long formula would be fragile.
- Recommend built-in spreadsheet tools when they are a better fit than formulas.

The point here is not to prove that everything can be done in one formula. It usually can. That does not mean it should.

4. Present a clear recommendation

- State what the table appears to contain.
- State what should be done first.
- Recommend the formula or workflow.
- Mention compatibility notes for Excel and WPS.
- Provide a fallback approach if the preferred formula may not work everywhere.

5. Get approval before doing the work

- If the next step would directly modify a workbook, add helper columns, rewrite formulas, or otherwise move from diagnosis into execution, pause and ask for confirmation.
- After the user agrees, move straight into the concrete work instead of restating the same analysis.

## What This Repository Should Handle Well

- messy office tables built from headers and sample rows
- cleanup order for blanks, duplicates, and format issues
- lookup and matching workflows across sheets
- summarization and categorization formulas
- common spreadsheet formula mistakes
- choosing between formulas, helper columns, split-text, filters, or pivot tables

In short, this repository should be most useful in the boring, high-frequency spreadsheet situations that people actually run into at work.

## Formula Selection Rules

- Start with the simplest workable formula.
- If a newer function is likely to be unavailable, provide a fallback.
- Prefer `INDEX + MATCH` over `XLOOKUP` when broad compatibility matters.
- Prefer step-by-step text cleanup over nested formulas when readability drops.
- Do not use advanced formulas only to appear clever.

If a formula starts looking like a puzzle, it is usually time to step back and use helper columns.

When the structure is clear enough, the output should be ready to turn into direct work as soon as the user says yes.

## Compatibility Rules

- Treat Excel and WPS compatibility as an early constraint.
- Mention when a suggested formula is best for newer Excel only.
- Offer a WPS-friendly or older-Excel-friendly alternative when possible.
- If compatibility is uncertain, recommend a safer helper-column workflow.

## Output Shape

Use a structure close to this:

### Diagnosis

- what the table likely contains
- what looks inconsistent or risky

### Recommendation

- what to do first
- which formula or method to use

### Execution

- what will be applied after approval
- which formulas, helper columns, or spreadsheet steps should be used

### Compatibility

- whether it should work in Excel
- whether it should work in WPS
- what fallback to use if needed

### Notes

- where to place the formula
- whether helper columns or built-in tools would be easier

The response should feel like a practical recommendation, not a function glossary.

## Boundaries

- Focus on practical spreadsheet handling, not full office automation.
- Do not prioritize styling, chart design, or visual formatting.
- Keep the project centered on diagnosis, cleanup, matching, and summarization.

That means this repository is intentionally better at fixing awkward tables than making them look impressive.
